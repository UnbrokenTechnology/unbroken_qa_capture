# Testing Sessions

This directory contains QA testing session files. Each session file is named by date (YYYY-MM-DD.md) and contains:

- Operating System
- Contio MeetingOS Version
- Environment (Dev | Staging | Beta | Production)
- Other relevant session context

The Linear ticket creation script reads these files to automatically populate ticket metadata.
